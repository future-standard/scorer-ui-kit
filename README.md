## Development

Local development is broken into two parts (ideally using two tabs).

First, run rollup to watch your `src/` module and automatically recompile it into `dist/` whenever you make changes.

```bash
npm start # runs rollup with watch flag
```

The second part will be running the `example/` create-react-app that's linked to the local version of your module.

```bash
# (in another tab)
cd example
npm start # runs create-react-app dev server
```

Now, anytime you make a change to your library in `src/` or to the example app's `example/src`, `create-react-app` will live-reload your local dev server so you can iterate on your component in real-time.

### SVGs

To compile SVGs..

```bash
#npm run svgr
cd ./src
npx @svgr/cli ./Icons/stroked/svg --svgo-config '{"plugins": [{"removeViewBox": false}]}' --out-dir ./Icons/stroked/ --template ./Icons/stroked/SVGRTemplate.js --typescript
```
