      introductionText={`
        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
        industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
        when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
        It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
        remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
        Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
        software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

    <PageHeader
      title='Why do we use it?'
      introductionText={`
        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content
        of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has
        a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here,
        content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages
        and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for
        'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have
        evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like)
      `}

    <PageHeader
      title='Where does it come from?'
      introductionText={`
          Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece
          of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock,
          a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure
          Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word
          in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
          1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by
          Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during
          the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line
          in section 1.10.32.

    <PageHeader
      title='Where can I get some?'
      introductionText={`
        There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority
        have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which
        don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum,
        you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the
        Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making
        this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words,
        combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks
        reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected
        humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
